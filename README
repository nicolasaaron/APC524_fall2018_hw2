Object-Oriented-ODE-Integrator

Integrator interface to solve 3 different ODE systems:

Duffing forced oscillator,
linear oscillator,
lorenz system,

using 3 different integration schemes:

4th order Runge Kutta
2nd order Adams bashforth
Explicit Euler


Description of files:

• model.h: an abstract base class Model for evaluating f(x, t)

• integrator.h: an abstract base class Integrator for ODE integrators

• duffing.{h,cc}: an implementation of the Duffing oscillator (a derived class of Model).

• linear-oscillator.{h,cc}: an implementation of the Linear oscillator (a derived class of Model).

• lorenz.{h,cc}: an implementation of the Lorenz system (a derived class of Model).

• euler.{h,cc}: an implementation of an explicit Euler integrator (a derived class of Integrator).

• rk4.{h,cc}: an implementation of an 4th order Runge Kutta integrator (a derived class of Integrator).

• ab2.{h,cc}: an implementation of an 2nd order Adams bashforth Integrator (a derived class of Integrator).

• ode_solve.cc: a driver program to integrate the ode system for the given parameter values and initial conditions.

• Makefile: builds the program ode_solve.

The general driver program ode_solve that lets you choose between the different equations and integration schemes. 

It reads commandline arguments in the following format:

ode_solve {equation} {integrator} {timestep} {numsteps}
